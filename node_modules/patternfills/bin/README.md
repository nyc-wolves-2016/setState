# Source Data Repository, Literally.

This is a good place to put interesting data that can serve as play data sets for visualization practice or data analysis.

## What should go here?

1. It should be a fairly small dataset.
2. It should be structured and processed (aka CSV or JSON)
3. It should come with a metadata file explaining where it's from and what it is.
4. Any updated versions of the data, scripts that generated or modified it etc. should be added too.
